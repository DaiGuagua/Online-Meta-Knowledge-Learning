## The main result of our paper
### Experiments of tracing changes in student knowledge on Synthetic dataset

The blue line in the figure represents the actual student ability change curve, while the orange line represents the change curve of student ability learned by the OMKL algorithm.

### Students' performance prediction

### Visualization of student knowledge state at each period
<img src="https://github.com/DaiGuagua/Online-Meta-Knowledge-Learning/blob/main/image/09_kt.png"  width="300" height="300"> 
Changes in knowledge state over time for the first student in the ASSISTment2009 dataset. The horizontal axis represents the time period, and the vertical axis represents expert conce.

### Visualization of student knowledge increment

The knowledge increment of the first three students in the ASSISTment dataset. Different students have different growth rates of knowledge, some students have fewer learning benefits, and some students have higher benefits.

### Knowledge graph construction

Knowledge Graph on our dataset. We divide the knowledge concepts into ten categories, and it can be seen that the knowledge concepts belonging to the same category
are more correlated.
